QTBigText is a simple qt4 application for displaying large text.
It works on any platform with QT, but it is packaged for the Nokia N9.

It reads the text from a default file and displays it as large as possible.
{It displays STDIN or cmdline args instead if either are present.}

There is a config file to change:
  -default file
  -colors
  -display size
  -wordwrap
